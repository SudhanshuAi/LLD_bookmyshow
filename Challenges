1. Simultaneous Seat Booking

Challenge -
Multiple clients attempting to reserve the same seats at the same time can create race conditions and double bookings.

Solution -
    1.Achieve Optimistic Locking with version numbers in the seats table
    2.Make use of Redis for distributed lock with SETNX operation
    3.Include a seat lock mechanism with an expiry (10 minutes)

2. Payment Race Conditions

Challenge-
Payment confirmations may take place after seat lock expiration or repeated payment attempts may be successful.

Solution-
    1.Apply idempotency keys to payments
    2.Apply a state machine to transitions in booking status
    3.Log payment attempts

3. High Concurrency During Popular Event Sales

Challenge
System may experience very high load when tickets for popular events are put on sale.

Solution
1.Enforce a waiting room through Redis sorted sets
2.Enforce queue-based processing for bookings
3.Cache counts of show availability

4. Database Load Management

Challenge
Excessive read operations on seat and show availability can burden the database.

Solution
    1.Enforce materialized views for show availability
    2.Enforce Redis cache for seat status
    3.Enforce read replicas with proper routing


5. Notification Reliability

Challenge
Proven delivery of booking confirmations through various channels.

Solution
    1.Absorb event-driven architecture with message queues
    2.Apply retry mechanisms with exponential backoff
    3.Store notification logs for tracking
