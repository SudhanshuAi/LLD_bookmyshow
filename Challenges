1. Concurrent Seat Booking

Challenge -
Multiple users trying to book the same seats simultaneously can lead to race conditions and double bookings.

Solution -
    1.Implement Optimistic Locking with version control in the seats table
    2.Use Redis for distributed locking with SETNX operation
    3.Implement a seat locking mechanism with expiry (10 minutes)


2. Payment Race Conditions

Challenge-
Payment confirmations might arrive after seat lock expiry or multiple payment attempts might succeed.

Solution-
    1.Implement idempotency keys for payment processing
    2.Use a state machine for booking status transitions
    3.Maintain payment attempt logs


3. High Concurrency During Popular Event Sales

Challenge
System might face extremely high load when tickets for popular events go on sale.

Solution
    1.Implement a waiting room using Redis sorted sets
    2.Use queue-based processing for bookings
    3.Cache show availability counts


4. Database Load Management

Challenge
Heavy read operations on show and seat availability can overload the database.

Solution
    1.Implement materialized views for show availability
    2.Use Redis cache for seat status
    3.Implement read replicas with appropriate routing


5. Notification Reliability

Challenge
Ensuring reliable delivery of booking confirmations across multiple channels.

Solution
    1.Implement event-driven architecture using message queues
    2.Use retry mechanisms with exponential backoff
    3.Maintain notification logs for tracking
